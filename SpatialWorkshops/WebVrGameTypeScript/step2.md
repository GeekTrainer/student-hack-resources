## Time to start building out the game!

Now you should have a basic understanding of whats in the starter project and what BabylonJS is doing for us. Next we want to add gravity so we need the CannonJS physics library mentioned above. 

We need to import the `CannonJSPlugin` after the `Mesh` in the package imports at the top of the script. When you add the plugin the import should look like it does below.

``` typescript
import { Engine, Scene, ArcRotateCamera, HemisphericLight, Vector3, MeshBuilder, Mesh, CannonJSPlugin } from "babylonjs";
```

Add this line of code at the top where we create the scene variable:

``` typescript
var gravityVector = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, -.03, 0);
scene.enablePhysics(gravityVector, new CannonJSPlugin);
```

Copy and paste the below code block under the `ground` variable. Here we are updating the `ground mesh` and giving it a `physicsImpostor` so that the sphere will fall and land on the ground.

``` typescript
    var light = new HemisphericLight("light",Vector3.Zero(),scene);

    camera.checkCollisions = true;
    camera.applyGravity = true;
    // Targets the camera to a particular position. In this case the scene origin
    camera.setTarget(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());

    // Attach the camera to the canvas
    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);

    // Add ground features and physics
    ground.material = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("groundMat", scene);
    ground.material.backFaceCulling = false;
    ground.receiveShadows = true;
    ground.physicsImpostor = new BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor(ground, BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor.BoxImpostor, { mass: 0, friction: 1, restitution: 0 }, scene);
```

Add physics, shadow and light to sphere by importing the `ShadowGenerator` and `DirectionalLight` packages at the top of the script.

```javascript
import { Engine, Scene, ArcRotateCamera, HemisphericLight, Vector3, MeshBuilder, Mesh, CannonJSPlugin, ShadowGenerator, DirectioalLight } from "babylonjs";
```

Then update the `create sphere` logic to the below:

``` typescript
// Create sphere
    var sphereLight = new DirectionalLight("dir02", new Vector3(0.2, -1, 0), scene);
    sphereLight.position = new Vector3(0, 80, 0);

    var sphere1: Mesh = MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("sphere", { diameter: 1 }, scene);
    sphere1.position.y = 5;
    sphere1.material = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("sphere material", scene)
    sphere1.physicsImpostor = new BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor(sphere1, BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor.SphereImpostor, { mass: 1 }, scene);
    var shadowGenerator = new ShadowGenerator(2048, sphereLight);
    shadowGenerator.addShadowCaster(sphere1);
```

Now we have a sphere falling onto the ground panel we created. How exciting. To change the speed in which the sphere falls change the `gravityVector` numbers!
