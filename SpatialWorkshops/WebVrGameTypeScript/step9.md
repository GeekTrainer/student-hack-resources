7. Leave the defaults for all the other fields the click `Review + create`
8. Click Create. It will take a minute to deploy and create your resource

18. Select `Change access level` from the top nav
19. Select `Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)`

21. Use the bread crumbs nav at the very top to navigate back to the static website pane.
22. Copy the `Primary endpoint` url and paste it into the browser. (Make sure the Index Document name is set to `index.html`)
