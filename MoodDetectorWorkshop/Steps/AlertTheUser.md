# Alert the user if sad faces are detected too often

In th [previous step](./CallTheWebApiFromDesktop.md) you connected the photo taking app to the Web Api and tested it out, uploading a picture and seeing the results of the analysis in Cosmos DB. In this step you will alert the user via the command line if sad faces are detected too often.

## Write the code

* Open the `picturetaker.py` file in Visual Studio Code.

* Add an import for the json package below the other imports
  
  ```python
  import json
  ```

* Add the following code just after the imports:
  
  ```python
  def check_sadness(emotions):
    if emotions['sadness'] >= 3:
      print('Are you feeling ok? Do you want to talk about it?')
  ```

* In the `upload` function, change the call to `post` the image to store the return value of this call and pass it to the new `check_sadness` function.
  
  ```python
  def upload(frame):
    ...
    results = requests.post(url=imageUrl, json=data)
    check_sadness(results.json())
  ```

## Run the code

There are two ways to run this code:

* Start debugging by either:
  * Select *Debug -> Start Debugging*
  * Press **F5**
  * Select the Debug pane from the toolbar on the left and select the green *Start Debugging* button.

  If you use one of these methods you will be able to set breakpoints and debug your code.

* Run this directly from the Visual Studio Code terminal using the command
  
  ```sh
  python picturetaker.py
  ```

  If you use this method you will not be able to set breakpoints and debug your code.

When the code runs, a window will appear showing the view from your camera. Press *Space* to take a photo and end the app. If more than 3 sad faces are detected you will see a message in the console output. Try this out by simulating various emotions.

## What does this code do

The overall flow of this code is:

1. Get the result from the post
2. Extract the number of times the sadness emotion was detected
3. If sadness was detected more than 3 times, output a message to the console

Lets look in more detail at the actual code.

```python
import json
```

This tells the Python compiler that we want to use `json` from the Python standard libraries - these come with Python so there is no need to install another package to use them.

```python
def check_sadness(emotions):
```

This code declares the `check_sadness` function to check the results for how many times sadness was detected based on a dictionary of emotion to count.

```python
if emotions['sadness'] >= 3:
    print('Are you feeling ok? Do you want to talk about it?')
```

The `emotions` dictionary is keyed of the emotion name, with the value being the count of the number of times that emotion was detected. This code checks the number of times sadness was detected and if it is greater than 3 prints a message to the console.

```python
results = requests.post(url=imageUrl, json=data)
```

This code gets the return value of the post and stores it as `results`.

```python
check_sadness(results.json())
```

The `json` property of the results returns the JSON automatically converted to a dictionary. This code then passes this dictionary to the `check_sadness` functions.

## Next step

In this step you alerted the user via the command line if sad faces are detected too often. In the [next step](./ViewTheResults.md) you will create a web page to view the data from the database.
