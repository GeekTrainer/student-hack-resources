# Hacking with Microsoft Azure

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) is a flexible, scalable, and full-featured cloud platform. If you can imagine it, you can build it on Azure, using the tools, languages and frameworks you're already familiar with. Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET - you can run them all on Azure.

Using Azure you can run serverless code using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/), [host web applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/) and [databases](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/databases/), take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) through [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), and create your own machine learning models through [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) or powerful [Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/).

## Getting started with Azure

### Creating an account

You can get started by creating an account on Azure. There's three different options available, depending on your current status as a student.

- [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) | $100 in Azure for 12 months with free tier of services - no credit card required with academic verification
- [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students-starter-faq/) | use select Azure products like App Services for free - no credit card required with academic verification
- [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) | $200 in Azure for one month with free tier of services - requires a credit card and probably the best fit for faculty evaluating Azure for course instruction unless your organization has a grant or enterprise agreement

### Learning on Azure

To help get you started, we've put together a few resources for you to peruse.
